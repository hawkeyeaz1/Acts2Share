 <li>We can never be good enough on our own</li><div class="verseref"></div>
 <li>We need God's forgiveness to be in His presence</li><div class="verseref"></div>

  <li>We get this by repenting of our sins, asking for forgineness, and accepting His forgiveness</li><div class="verseref"></div>

 <h1>Posting Need</h1>
 <ul>
  <li>You post your need.<br /></li>
  <li>An email is sent to you and to the church you designated.<br />Your email allows you to:</li>
  <ul>
   <li>link directly to your post</li>
   <li>edit</li>
   <li>close when the need is met</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Your church may email you directly to ask/check additional information,<br />i.e. "You are Jane Austin, right?"</li>
  <li>If your church cannot meet the need readily, your church will approve your post and spread the need at your church</li>
  <li>Others will see and, as they are able, will respond.<br />Your church will receive copies of the emails</li>
  <li>Once your need is met, you will use your email to close the request</li>
 </ul>
 <br />
 <h2>The need is routed through your church to:</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>Provide you protection</li>
  <li>Expose your need for prayer</li>
  <li>Possible faster fulfillment</li>
  <li>Possibly allow the giver to get a tax credit</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<div id="rightbar">
 <h1>Giving</h1>

  <ul>
   <li>If your help is accepted, the church will be in contact with you to arrange things</li>
   <li>If your help is declined (due to need being met, for example), you have no obligation to that need</li>
  </ul>
  <li>You will provide the needed help</li>

<div id="verse">Acts 4:32 Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul; neither did anyone say that any of the things he possessed was his own, but they had all things in common.<br />
 34 Nor was there anyone among them who lacked; for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,<br />
 35 and laid them at the apostles feet; and they distributed to each as anyone had need.
 36 And Joses,[a] who was also named Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite of the country of Cyprus, 37 having land, sold it, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet.

<div class="verse">1 Timothy 6:18 Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share...</div><br />
<div class="verse">Hebrews 13:16 But do not forget to do good and to share, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</div><br />

All posts, comments and interactions should follow the purpose of the site (to allow people to post needs, and to help meet needs) and also comply with the following verses:
<br /><br />
<div class="verse">Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy-meditate on these things.</div><div class="verseref">Philippians 4:8</div><br /><br />
<div class="verse">Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, leading to edification.</div><div class="verseref">Romans 15:2</div><br /><br />
<div class="verse">How is it then, brethren? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</div><div class="verseref">1 Corinithans 14:26	</div><br /><br />
<div class="verse">Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers.</div><div class="verseref">Ephisians 4:29</div><br /><br />
<div class="verse">Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing. Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</div><div class="verseref">1 Corinthians 13:1-8</div><br /><br />
